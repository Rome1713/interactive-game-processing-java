# STAR PEACE

This repository now contains the **STAR PEACE** Processing sketch—a radiant, mouse-driven arcade blaster with collectible juggling, bullet-based bomb defusing, and a lush parallax night sky.

## Where the code lives

All of the source code lives in [`STAR_PEACE/STAR_PEACE.pde`](STAR_PEACE/STAR_PEACE.pde). Copy that folder into your Processing sketchbook so the folder name matches the main `.pde` file.

## How to run the game

1. **Install Processing** – Download Processing from [processing.org/download](https://processing.org/download) and install it for your OS.
2. **Find the sketchbook** – Launch Processing once, then open **File → Preferences** to note the sketchbook location.
3. **Copy the project** – Drop the entire `STAR_PEACE` folder from this repository into that sketchbook directory.
4. **Open the sketch** – In Processing choose **File → Sketchbook → STAR_PEACE**. The editor opens a single tab named `STAR_PEACE`.
5. **Run it** – Press ▶️ (or `Ctrl + R` / `Cmd + R`) to launch the 720×540 window and start playing immediately.

## Gameplay highlights

- **Glow-up visuals** – Gradient dusk sky, soft vignette, and layered starfield animate behind the action.
- **Collectible variety** – Juicy coins, spinning gems, bombs with fuses, and pulsing hearts each feature bespoke glows and particles.
- **Mouse + shooting** – Glide with the mouse, hold click or space to fire shimmering bullets that safely defuse bombs.
- **Combo scoring** – Build streaks for up to a 5× multiplier, with pop-up status messages celebrating each pickup.
- **Shield system** – Hearts add lives and a shield aura that can absorb one bomb impact.
- **Instant restarts** – Click after game over to reset the run with fresh spawn pacing.

Tweak colors, spawn logic, or particle counts directly inside the single sketch file to customize STAR PEACE to your liking.
